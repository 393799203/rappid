# Rappid Demo Application

This application showcases the Rappid plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

## Running the application

Due to Same-Origin policy implemented in the majority of browsers to prevent content from being accessed if the file exists on another domain, it is recommended to access the application through a **Web server**. The application might work only partially when viewed from a filesytem location.

A simple HTTP server (requires `Node.js` and `npm`) is part of this demo. To install and start the server, please run `npm install` followed by `npm start` from the `KitchenSink` directory.

The application is also available online [here](http://jointjs.com/rappid).
